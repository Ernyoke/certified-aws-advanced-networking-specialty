# Route 53

## Public Hosted Zones

- A hosted zone is a DNS database for a given section of the global DNS database
- Route 53 is a globally resilient service. The nameservers are distributed globally and have the same dataset
- Hosted zones are created automatically if we register a domain
- We can create them separately if we want to register a domain elsewhere
- There is a monthly fee for the hosted zone and for the number of queries made to the hosted zone
- A zone hosts DNS records, example A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT, etc.
- Hosted zones are authoritative for a domain, when we register a domain, nameserver records for it will enter into the top level domain zone, which will point to our nameservers. Our nameservers will become authoritative for that domain
- A public hosted zone is DNS database, a zone file hosted by R53 on public nameservers
- They are accessible from the public internet and form our VPCs
- When a public hosted zone is created, R53 allocates 4 nameservers for this hosted zone. These nameservers are accessible from the public internet and from the VPC is DNS is enabled
- From the VPC the access method is direct, the VPC resolver using the VPC +2 address
- From the public internet, we access the root zones first and proceed to walk the tree to get the IP for the DNS

## Private Hosted Zones

- Private hosted zones are similar to public hosted zones, but they are not public to the whole internet
- They are associated with VPCs, they can be only access within these VPCs
- We use them to create resource records which are resolvable from the VPCs
- It is possible to use split-view: we can use the same address for public and private DNS
- Split View/Split Horizon DNS:

## CNAME vs ALIAS

- In DNS an `A` records maps a `NAME` to an IP address, while a `CNAME` record maps a `NAME` to another name (example: `example.io` => `1.3.3.7` and `www.example.io` => `example.io`)
- We cannot use a `CNAME` for the apex domain
- Many AWS services, such as ELBs, do not provide an IP address, only a DNS name, so we can not point the apex domain to these services
- This problem is fixed by the `ALIAS` record
- An `ALIAS` record maps a `NAME` to an AWS resource
- It can be used for both apex and normal records, for non-apex records we can use `CNAME` records
- There is no charge for `ALIAS` requests pointing to an AWS resource
- An `ALIAS` record is a subtype, we can have `A` record alias and a `CNAME` record alias
- The `ALIAS` record is a record implement by AWS and it falls outside of the DNS standard

## Simple Routing

- Simple routing starts with a hosted zone
- With simple routing we can create one record per name
- Each record can have multiple values. For the client these records are returned and the client can chose one by random
- Limitation of simple routing is that it does not support health checks

## Health Checks

- Health checks are separate from, but they are used by records
- We configure them separately from records, they are used to evaluate the health of a 
- Health checks are performed by a fleet of health checkers globally, we need to allow them
- They can be used to check anything (not just AWS instances) on the internet
- Health checks are performed every 30s, we can have more granular health checks (at every 10s) at extra cost
- Checks can be TCP, HTTP/HTTPS (target should respond with a 200/300 status within 2 seconds), HTTP/HTTPS with String Matching (response body should also be received within 2 seconds)
- Based on these health checks and endpoint can be `Healthy` or `Unhealthy`
- Checks can be on these 3 types:
    - Endpoint checks: assess the health of an actual endpoint
    - CloudWatch Alarm: react to CloudWatch Alarms
    - Checks of other checks - calculated: monitors the application as a whole, involves the health status of individual app components

## Failover Routing

- With failover routing we can add multiple routing of the same name (primary and secondary)
- Each of these records points at a resource
- A common architecture is a to use failover for a "out of band" failure/maintenance page for a service
- Failover routing involves the presence of a health check
- If the target of the health check is healthy, the primary record is used, otherwise the traffic is directed to the secondary target
- Use case: active/passive failover

## Multi Value Routing

- It is a mixture of simple and failover routing
- With multi value routing we can create many records all with the same name
- Each of the records can have an associated health checks, when queried, up to 8 healthy records are returned to the client. If more than 8 exist, 8 are randomly selected
- Any of the record which fails the checks, wont be returned to the client and wont be selected to route traffic to
- Multi value routing is not a substitute for a load balancer, but it can improve the availability of the application by letting the client chose to which IP to connect

## Weighter Routing

- Can be used when we are looking for a simple form of load balancing or when we want to test new versions of a software
- With weighted routing we can specify a weight to each record
- For a given name, the total name is calculated. Each record will be returned based on its weighting compared to total weight
- Setting a record weight to 0, the record will never be returned
- Weighted routing can be combined with health checks
- **Health checks don't remove records from the calculation!** If an unhealthy record is selected, the selection will be retried until we get a healthy record

## Latency-Based Routing

- Should we used when we try to optimise for performance and user experience
- We have multiple records with the same name, for each record we can specify an AWS region, where the infrastructure for that record is located
- In the background AWS maintains a latency database between different regions of the world. For example, it will know if an user from Australia has a certain latency to ap-southeast-2 and other latency to us-east-1, us-west-1, etc.
- The record with the lowest latency is selected and returned to the user
- It can be combined with health checks, if the lowest latency record is unhealthy, the record with the lower latency is returned from the other existing ones
- The database maintained by AWS is not real-time, it can not take in consideration any local issues with the network which

## Geolocation Routing

- Geolocation routing is similar to latency-based routing, only instead of latency the location of customer and resources is used to determine the resolution decisions
- When we create records, we tag the records with a location
- This location is generally a country (ISO2 code), continent or default. There can be also a subdivision, in USA we can tag records with a state
- When the user does a query, an IP checks verifies the location is the user
- Geolocation does not return the closest record, it returns relevant records: when the resolution happens, the location of the user is cross-checked with the location specified for the records and the matching on is returned
- Order of the cross-checks is the following:
    1. R53 checks the state (US only)
    2. R53 checks the country
    3. R53 checks the continent
    4. Returns default if not previous match
- If no match is detected, the a `NO ANSWER` is returned
- Geolocation is ideal for restricting content based on the location of the user
- It can be used for load-balancing based on user location as well

## Geoproximity Routing

- Geoproximity aims to provide records as close to the customer as possible, aims to calculated the distance between to record and customer and return the record with the lower one
- When using geoproximity, we define rules:
    - Region the resource is created in if it is an AWS resource
    - Lat/lon coordinate for external resources
    - Bias
- Geoproximiy allows defining a bias: it can be a `+` or `-` bias, increasing or decreasing the region size. We can influence the routing distance based on this bias

## R53 Interoperability

- Route53 acts as a domain registrar and as a domain hosting
- We can also register domains using other external services
- Steps happening when we register a domain using R53:
    - R53 accepts the registration fee
    - Allocates 4 Name Servers
    - Creates a zone file (domain hosting) on the NS
    - R53 communicates with the registry of the top level domain and adds the address of the 4 NS for the given domain
- Route53 acting as a registrar only:
    - We pay for the domain for Route53 but the name servers are allocated by other entity
    - We have to allocate the name servers to Route53 which will communicate with the top level domain registry
- Using Route53 for hosting only:
    - Generally used for existing domains. The domain is registered at third party
    - We create a hosted zone inside R53 and provide the address of the name servers to the third party
