# Amazon Inspector

- Is a product designed to check EC2 instances and the operating systems running on those instances for any vulnerabilities or deviations against best practice
- Inspector can be run for a certain period of time (15 min, 1 hour, 1 day, etc.) to identify any unusual traffic and configurations which can put instances to risk
- Provides a report of findings ordered by severity
- Inspector can work with 2 main type of assessment per instances:
    - **Network Assessment**: can be conducted agentless, but adding a agent provides additional richer information
    - **Network and Host Assessment**: requires an agent to be installed. Looks at OS level vulnerabilities
- **Rules packages**: determine what is checked on an instance
- Examples of rule packages:
    - **Network Reachability**: 
        - Can be done with no agent or with an agent providing OS visibility
        - Checks reachability end to end
        - Returns the following findings:
            - `RecognizedPortWithListener`
            - `RecognizedPortNoListener`
            - `RecognizedPortNoAgent`
            - `UnrecognizedPortWithListener`: Macie can identify any unrecognized ports exposed to listeners
    - **Host Assessment**:
        - Agent is required
        - Checks for Common vulnerabilities and exposures (**CVE**)
        - Center for Internet Security (**CIS**) Benchmarks
