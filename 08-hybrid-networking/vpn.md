# AWS Site-to-Site VPN

- A Site-to-Site VPN is a logical connections between a VPC and an on-premise network running over the public internet. The connection is encrypted using IPSec
- Can be fully HA if it is implemented correctly
- It is quick to provision, it can be provisioned in less than an hour (contrast to DX)
- Components involved in creating a VPN connection:
    - **VPC**
    - **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)**: it is a gateway object which can be the target of one or more rules in a Route Tables. It can be associated to a single VPC
    - **Customer Gateway (CGW)**: can refer to 2 different things:
        - Often is referred to the logical configuration in AWS
        - Physical on-premises router which the VPN connects to
    - **VPN Connection** itself: the connection linking the VGW from the AWS to the CGW
- Static vs Dynamic VPN:
    - **Dynamic VPN** uses BGP protocol, if customer router does not support BGP, we can not use dynamic VPNs
    - **Static VPN** uses static network configuration: static routes are added to the route tables AWS side, static networks has to be identified on the VPN connection on-premise side. It is simple, it just uses IPSec, works anywhere, having limitation on terms of HA
    - Dynamic VPN uses BGP: allows routing on the fly, allows multiple links to be used at once between the same locations. Allows using HA available architectures.
        - Route propagation: if enabled means that routes are added ro the Route Table automatically
- Considerations for VPN:
    - Speed Limitation for VPN: *1.25 Gbps*, AWS limitation
    - Latency considerations: inconsistent, traffic goes through the public internet
    - Cost: hourly cost for outgoing traffic
    - VPN can be used for Direct Connect backup or they can be used over the Direct Connect for adding a layer of encryption
